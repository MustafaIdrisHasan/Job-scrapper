Think semiconductor-fab levels of precision applied to the chaotic world of prototyping and low-volume production. The result? A10x throughput improvementin one of the world's most foundational industries.We've raised$20Mfrom top-tier investors, includingY CombinatorandGoogle Ventures, and we're alreadyprofitable. Our customers include industry leaders likeTesla, Meta,andZipline.The Grid isn't a prototype. It's live, scaling fast, and delivering real revenue. We're now building the engineering core that will scale it further.What We're Looking ForWe’re looking for an engineer to found ourcomputer visionteam. We currently deploy a variety of learned models for circuit board defect detection and bin picking. We are looking for a founding engineer to architect our labelling pipeline and improve and expand the range of deployed models. This is an incredibly high-impact role that will directly contribute to 3x revenue growth over the next year.Who This Role Is ForThis role would suit a full-stack computer vision engineer comfortable building front-end labelling tools and training models. This is not a pure research position.Example TasksDecide what data we should be capturing about PCB defectsDesign and implement a database schema and front-end labelling toolTrain vision models using the labelled dataLocationRemote or work from one of our labs in the UK (London, Cambridge) or USA (Boston)Why This Role MattersThe work of the computer vision team will be critical to making electronics manufacturing economically viable in the USA and Europe. This is acareer-defining opportunityfor a high-agency engineer.

Motion design tools like After Effects require mastering complex user interfaces, turning creative work into button-clicking hell. We're starting with motion design because it's the most painful and expensive part of video creation.Hera is the first AI motion designer that creates professional animations through conversation. Unlike video-gen tools, Hera generates code-based animations where every parameter can be fine-tuned through prompts or on-canvas editing, giving users the control of After Effects with the simplicity of Lovable.In our first two weeks after launch, users created over 200,000 animations.Our founders:Peter Tribelhorn (CEO) built YouTube channels with 50B+ views. Chia-Lun Wu (CTO) was one of the first developers at Vyond, where he built their video editor used by 20,000 businesses today.About the RoleBuild and optimize AI systems to generate high-quality animations that follow core motion design principles (easing, non-linear movement, visual hierarchy)Develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess animation quality, combining automated metrics with expert validation from motion designersPartner with motion designers and marketers to translate professional design knowledge into AI training data and evaluation criteriaDesign and implement fine-tuning pipelines that teach Hera domain-specific animation styles and brand guidelinesCreate feedback loops between user preferences, expert input, and model performance to continuously improve animation qualityResearch and prototype state-of-the-art approaches for controllable, style-consistent motion graphics generationTech StackOur technology choices evolve with our needs. Current core technologies include TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL, GCP/AWS, and our proprietary motion graphics engine.
